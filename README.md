# ABS labour force report automation   

This repository contains a minimal viable example of an R data visualisation and report generation workflow using ABS labour force open data.   

The contents of this repository have been created to support the [Automating R Markdown report generation - Part 2](https://github.com/erikaduan/r_tips/blob/master/tutorials/p-automating_rmd_reports/p-automating_rmd_reports_part_2.md) tutorial in my [`r_tips`](https://github.com/erikaduan/r_tips) repository.
